# Term Deposit Prediction - MLOps Playground Challenge

## Objective: 
Build a complete Machine Learning pipeline that predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. 

The project should include:
                   - Data loading and preprocessing
                   - Model training and evaluation
                   - Experiment tracking using MLflow
                   - Unit testing with Pytest
                   - Deployment using FastAPI


## Steps:

### Data Preprocessing

                    - Load CSV data into pandas dataframe
                    - handle nill and missing values
                    - Encode categorical variables
                    - Train-test split

### Model Training
                    -  train diffrent classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
                    -  Save the trained model

### Experiment Tracking with MLflow
                    -  Log metrics, parameters, and model artifacts
                    -  Track different model runs for comparison

### Unit Testing with Pytest
                    -  Create tests for each stage (data loading, preprocessing, training)
                    -  Ensure pipeline robustness

### FastAPI
